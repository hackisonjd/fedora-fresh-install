# fedora-fresh-install
A script for Fedora meant to be ran after a fresh install as a quality of life feature for me.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/hackisonjd/fedora-fresh-install` and enter the directory with `cd fedora-fresh-install`
2. Run the .sh file with `./start.sh` on your Fedora 41 system.
    1. If you get a permission denied error, be sure to do `chmod a+x` to make it runnable.

I haven't tested this with any other releases, including Silverblue, so don't get mad at me if they don't work there.
